    Have you ever fumbled the perfect opportunity with the perfect someone?
    Are you shy and introverted and much rather talk to a computer rather than other people?
    ‎ 
    Well, no need to worry because Western Dating Sim is here to rescue! 
    Embark on this once-in-a-lifetime journey as you play through a fun interactive visual novel with a 
    romantic (but more importantly educational 😏) element with Serena, a shy CS student who enjoys 
    playing music and art. 
    
    Go on walks together across campus, fun boba dates, and most importantly 
    get ready to take some notes for your next social encounter in the wild 🌴!
