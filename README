# Western Dating Simulator (GROUP 29) 🟪⬜

### By: Lecia Cheng, Jasmine Gu, Ethan Rong, Aaron Xie, and Jasper Yang

Have you ever fumbled the perfect opportunity with the perfect someone?  
Are you shy and introverted and much rather talk to a computer rather than other people?

Well, no need to worry because Western Dating Sim is here to the rescue! Embark on this once-in-a-lifetime journey as you play through a fun interactive visual novel with a romantic (but more importantly educational 😏) element with Serena, a shy CS student who enjoys playing music and art.

Go on walks together across campus, fun boba dates, and most importantly get ready to take some notes for your next social encounter in the wild 🌴!
